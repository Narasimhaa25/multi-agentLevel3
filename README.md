Level 3 ‚Äî LLM + Multi-Step Tool Use (Full Agentic AI)

This project is the third level of a multi-stage AI assignment. At this level, we extend the LLM + single-tool chatbot from Level 2 into a multi-step agentic system.

The focus here is on multi-step reasoning and tool chaining:
	‚Ä¢	The agent breaks complex queries into multiple sub-tasks.
	‚Ä¢	Sub-tasks are delegated to the correct tool (calculator, translator) or directly answered by the LLM.
	‚Ä¢	Multiple steps can be executed in sequence (e.g., translate ‚Üí calculate, or calculate ‚Üí LLM).
	‚Ä¢	The chatbot maintains execution order and memory across steps.
	‚Ä¢	All interactions are logged with a timestamp for history.

You: What is the distance between Earth and Mars?
Bot: The distance between Earth and Mars is constantly changing because both planets are orbiting the Sun at different speeds and distances.  There's no single answer.

At their closest approach (a phenomenon called "opposition"), Earth and Mars can be approximately **54.6 million kilometers (33.9 million miles)** apart.  At their furthest, they can be over **401 million kilometers (249 million miles)** apart.
